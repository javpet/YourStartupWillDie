      <h1>Your Startup Will Die...</h1>
      <p>No, not by tomorrow morning, but eventually at some point if you let it happen. You haven't even started yet? Even better. Do you know how many haters are out there? A LOT, have you checked reddit these days? So why don’t you take advantage
        of people sharing the dreadful ending of your project?</p>

    <section class="yswd_how">
      <h2>How?</h2>
      <p>  Thanks to Nobel prize winner <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555" target="_blank">Daniel Kahneman</a> the whole world could leverage the action-packed methodology called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem" target="_blank">pre-mortem</a>, which eliminates thinking biases and focus on the potential weakness(es) of an idea.</p>
      <p>The essence of the notion is to get away from being closed into the belief that it's going to be successful by predicting the disastrous ending of it. Luckily using haters' valid opinion on your product / feature, they already making the
        backlog for you to prolong this ending.</p>
